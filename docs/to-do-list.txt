--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
|   In General:
|
|   *) Translations
|      https://github.com/dataformsjs/dataformsjs/blob/master/docs/i18n-translations.md
|   *) More Examples (for all or most scripts and features)
|   *) More Documentation
|   *) More Unit Testing
|   *) Additional Scripts and Features
|
|   There is no priority to this list.
|   All contributions are welcome.
|
|   Generally every item in this list is of low priority and more of a
|   wish list item rather than an actual need. The highest priority items
|   are at the top and start with `**)`. Development typically occurs
|   based on the need of real world production sites and apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**) Combine Main Server and AI/ML Server into one.
    - Servers:
        https://www.dataformsjs.com/
        https://ai-ml.dataformsjs.com/
    - This site doesn't get enough traffic to need separate servers
    - Planned to use nginx for PHP, Node/GraphQL, Python/Flask on the same server
    - Related setup docs for current setup:
        https://github.com/dataformsjs/website/blob/master/docs/Main%20Site%20Server%20Setup.txt
        https://github.com/dataformsjs/website/blob/master/docs/Python%20Webserver%20Setup%20for%20AI_ML%20Functions.txt
    - This will likely be documented in a new markdown doc
    - Likely include the playground server:
        https://playground.dataformsjs.com/
    - Playground code could be moved to the main website repository from:
        https://github.com/dataformsjs/playground
    - Or to avoid any changes if possible the bash script could be updated to merge the two
        repositories when it syncs the server.
    - To handle that the [index.php] would check host 'playground.dataformsjs.com'
        or a new Request Header 'X-Playground' to determine which file to include [app.php]
        or migrated [playground.php]
    - A main issue to handle is how to setup HTTPS with https://letsencrypt.org/
        when the host is already being used by another static IP.
        More time to research and test this is needed.
    - Use HTTP/2 instead of http/1.1
        This can be done if migrating servers to nginx instead of Apache

**) Priority for additional Documentation and Examples
    - Add Markdown and related docs to Quick Ref Section
    - Add Web Component API examples to quick ref section of the main site
        'app:contentReady', etc
        - Currently the places demo and other demos provide good examples
          when viewing source code of the demo.
    - Publish a nice looking version and more useful of markdown
        demos in the examples section of the main site.
        - Current Demos used for Development:
            https://www.dataformsjs.com/examples/markdown-web.htm
            https://www.dataformsjs.com/examples/markdown-react.htm#/
            https://www.dataformsjs.com/examples/markdown-vue.htm
            https://www.dataformsjs.com/examples/markdown-hbs.htm
    - Update jsxLoader doc based on updates and findings from this issue:
        https://github.com/dataformsjs/dataformsjs/issues/16
        * How to use with node and webpack
        * Also add new `data-type="module"` to doc.
            * Added for release `5.4.0`
    - Create a new repository showing how to use DataFormsJS
            with webpack: https://webpack.js.org/
        - The DataFormsJS React Components have been developed and tested
            using create-react-app, webpack, etc; however the main framework,
            web components, and the jsxLoader were not originally tested with webpack
        - Basics:
            - Import files directly, future docs can go into detail on why
            # Framework
            import 'dataformsjs/js/DataFormsJS'
            import 'dataformsjs/js/plugins/navLinks'
            # JSX Loader
            import 'dataformsjs/js/react/jsxLoader'
                # To prevent side effects from the jsxLoader on webpack set
                # the following directly in the related script.
                jsxLoader.isSupportedBrowser = true;
                jsxLoader.needsPolyfill = false;
                jsxLoader.setup = function() { };
            # Web Components
            import 'dataformsjs/js/web-components/json-data'
            import 'dataformsjs/js/web-components/data-table'
        - Also likely another repository [create-dataformsjs-app] using
            [create-react-app] as a starter to show how to use DataFormsJS
            with [create-react-app].
    - Create a markdown overview doc using Web Components
        - Will cover overview and details - similar to the JSX Loader doc:
            https://github.com/dataformsjs/dataformsjs/blob/master/docs/jsx-loader.md
        - Topics to cover:
            - SPA Routing
            - Using to download JSON Data and bind to other elements on screen
            - How data binding works
            - Web Component "Services" Concept
                Need to add template for this in quick ref section on main site
            - How the polyfill works and reason it was created over other options
            - How to test the polyfill with modern browsers:
                Just use:
                    <script src="../js/web-components/polyfill.js"></script>
                Instead of:
                    <script nomodule src="../js/web-components/polyfill.js"></script>
        - Provide examples of how [polyfill.js].[getRootUrl()] works for documentation.
            - Or add a markdown doc for it
            - Here is an example of an defining a custom URL from the app:
                <script>
                    window.dataformsjsUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/js/';
                    window.dataformsjsMinFiles = false; // Optional (defaults to `true`)
                </script>
                <script nomodule src="../js/web-components/polyfill.js"></script>
            - By default the path will be determined from where [/web-components/polyfill.js] is defined:
                <script src="../js/web-components/polyfill.min.js"></script>
                    [*.min.js] Framework files will be downloaded
                <script src="../js/web-components/polyfill.js"></script>
                    Full [*.js] Framework files will be downloaded
        - Once a Web Component and Framework doc are created then both those docs
            along with jsxLoader and Readme could be added as a new "Documentation"
            page on the main site using the new <markdown-content> component

**) Playground Site
    - Need to add support for JSON file/resource type
    - Add linting for React/JSX, Babel recently started doing this online in the REPL:
        https://babeljs.io/repl
    - Currently JS is linted using jshint on the Playground, to lint JSX babel standalone will
        likely be used with a custom Code Mirror Plugin
    - When adding update the JS page code to load jshint and a linter for JSX only if the
        user is actually going to create a site. It can be downloaded in the background
        while the site is being created.

*) Web Components Updates
    - <json-data>
        - Add support for custom Request Headers.
        - For how the standard Framework handles this see code related to [app.settings.requestHeaders].
        - React <JsonData> uses props
        - The Web Components version will likely use global variables to be defined from JS:
            <script>
                window.requestHeaders = {}
                window.requestHeadersByHostName = {}
            And then the Framework [app.getRequestHeaders] and related code can be used as a starting point
            If using this option it will be easy to work with the the framework when using [polyfill.js]
        - If adding `window.requestHeaders` and `window.requestHeadersByHostName` then any Web Component
            that uses fetch such as <markdown-content> should also use the headers - just like the Framework
            versions of the code.
    - Create a new <form is="entry-form"> Component
        - A Framework JavaScript control could be created as the Polyfill. Ideally the new control
            would use functions from the main entryForm page object so it doesn't have to be duplicated.
        - Existing Framework Demo:
            https://www.dataformsjs.com/examples/entry-form-demo-vue.htm
        - This may or may not ever be created. It's not a priority until needed for an actual production site.
            Web Components (as of release 5.0.0) contain a new easy to use JavaScript API that allows for
            a site to be extended using only basic JavaScript functions so it's easy to build custom
            entry form apps.
        - If it doesn't make sense to create <form is="entry-form"> then the demo can
            be re-created using custom JS
    - Create a new Web Component for advanced drop-down/select lists?
        - Would use behavior and features from:
            https://react-select.com/home
            https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
            https://select2.org/
            https://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/
            https://joshuajohnson.co.uk/Choices/
            https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift
            https://vue-multiselect.js.org/
        - If there is a good Web Component alternative then this does not need to be created
        - Needed features:
            - Show Images, this can be done with the templating feature similar to <data-list> / <data-table>
            - Different Value/Label - for example Country Code [value] but Country Name for user list
            - Type to filter
            - Multiple select with tags
            - [role="listbox"] - example in: website/public/html/getting-started.htm
            - or use [aria-autocomplete="list" role="combobox"] / Need to research more at time of development
        - Possible names:
            <data-select>
            <web-select>
            <image-select>
    - Add Unit Testing
        - Currently only the main Framework and the React [jsxLoader.js] have Unit Testing

*) Add TypeScript Declarations
    https://docs.skypack.dev/package-authors/package-checks#types
    https://humanwhocodes.com/snippets/2020/10/create-typescript-declarations-from-javascript-jsdoc/
    https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/by-example.html

*) New plugin or features to handle content preloading?
    - For example routes could have a [data-preload] attribute and then a new plugin would
        download and cache all content in memory when the first page is opened.
        Other options for preloading could be added as well if they make sense.
    - This can could be developed and tested on the main site.
    - Ideally all related code would go in a new plugin and not the main [DataFormsJS.js] file
    - An alternative option to consider is to update `refreshAllHtmlControls()` so it processes
        multiple downloads on the screen async. If doing this it will still need to include the
        recursive logic to handle all nested elements.
    - Also related on the main site some content is only downloaded and displayed when the user
      clicks an example. This is not SEO friendly and can cause a delay for users with slow mobile
      devices. Ideally [role="tab"] would be used with content preloading.
      Currently all tabs on the main site point to the same tabpanel and content is replaced once the
      the user clicks the button.
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Tab_Role
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/ARIA:_tabpanel_role
    - Code for the home page is here:
        https://github.com/dataformsjs/website/blob/master/public/html/home-page.htm
        https://github.com/dataformsjs/website/blob/master/public/js/page-home-page.js
        - See code related to `code.setAttribute('data-template-url', page);`

*) Additional Markdown Docs to Create
    - Build Process
    - How Unit Testing Works
        See additional notes in this doc related to Unit Testing
    - Both of the above topics are covered briefly in:
        https://github.com/dataformsjs/dataformsjs/blob/master/docs/jsx-loader.md
    - Should a new section on the main site be created that uses [jsx-loader.md]
        and future new docs as the source? A proof of concept should be created
        to see how this would work.

*) Demos
    - React examples of the following:
        - https://www.dataformsjs.com/examples/entry-form-demo-hbs.htm
        - https://www.dataformsjs.com/examples/binary-classification-vue.htm#/en/
        - One option is to use https://react-hook-form.com/
        - A new <EntryForm> and related components might be created in the future as well (not yet decided on though)
    - Create standard framework demo for Hacker News Demo:
        dataformsjs\examples\hacker-news-react.htm
        dataformsjs\examples\hacker-news-web.htm
        - This would use a custom page object and JavaScript rather than nested JSON controls
    - One Page Site Demos are functional but very ugly:
        [examples/one-page-site-hbs.htm]
        [examples/one-page-and-spa-hbs.htm]
        - These should be updated with some basic info such as how they work and made to look nice
        - [one-page-and-spa-hbs.htm] was started based on the [template-files-hbs.htm] page
            so some content on the SPA pages is not needed

*) Add options for lazy load scripts from [app.loadScript], [app.loadScripts], and Web Component
    `window.lazyLoad = {}` to include support for additional attributes. For example without
    the [crossorigin] attribute on <script> elements detailed errors are not shown. However
    [crossorigin] can't be included by default because it actually requires the server to
    support CORS. To see an example use the playground and add this to the bottom of the
    main page. Then run it with an without 'crossorigin'.
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
            var url = 'https://dataformsjs.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tmp/calcPage.js';
            var script = document.createElement('script');
            script.setAttribute('crossorigin', 'anonymous');
            script.src = url;
            document.head.appendChild(script);
        });
    Mozilla Docs:
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script

*) Version for deno of [dataformsjs/server/app.js]
    Allow server to start with either deno or node

*) Possibly link to Unit Tests from the footer on the main site
    - Current URL (hidden - not linked from anywhere):
        https://www.dataformsjs.com/unit-testing/
    - Possible new URL:
        https://www.dataformsjs.com/en/unit-tests
    - The current URL would then redirect
    - If adding documentation to the main site these could simply be linked from that page
    - New page would need to look nice and provide a brief overview
    - Currently many Vue unit tests fail if using IE so this might have to be fixed first
        (either that or simply add notes to the page regarding IE and Vue)

*) Template Files
    - File [dataformsjs\examples\_template.htm] should be separated for different options and include a hello world or display of JSON data:
        _template_{hbs, vue, react}.htm

*) Additional Unit Testing for Vue
    - Currently Vue has to skip many tests due to how Virtual DOM works differently than templating
    - Possibly a new page, not yet decided on, low priority as everything works and it passes many tests
    - Currently many tests fail in IE with the Vue, however all demos work correctly

*) The Hacker News API Demo (link below) will likely be combined into a larger Public API's Demo
    - https://www.dataformsjs.com/examples/hacker-news-react.htm
    - Other API's to start:
        https://api.github.com/emojis
    - Once completed the page can be added to the examples section on the main site

*) jsxLoader.js
    - More unit testing (every line of code needs to be verified), unit tests run from:
        http://127.0.0.1:5000/unit-testing-react
        http://127.0.0.1:5000/unit-testing-preact
    - It's possible that every line it tested but it's not yet known for sure
    - Possible new functions to support JavaScript version by year for new Syntax, example:
        jsxLoader.requireES2018 = function() {
            this.evalCode = '"use strict"; const { id, ...other } = { id:123, test:456 };';
        };
        For example if the app uses spread sytax and calls `jsxLoader.requireES2018()` then
        browsers that don't support it (UC Browser, Edge) would use Babel. Currently this
        feature requires the developer of the app to to update `evalCode`.
        This issue is documented in the main JSX doc:
            https://github.com/dataformsjs/dataformsjs/blob/master/docs/jsx-loader.md
    - Development Tips for working with the Parser:
        - Make sure to set the following on the calling page:
            jsxLoader.logCompileTime = true;
            jsxLoader.logCompileDetails = true;
        - Once possible location of error has been found add code similar to the below item,
            search for 'debug here' in DevTools and then add a breakpoint:
                if (state.value === " render") {
                    console.log('debug here');
                    console.log(node);
                    console.log(tokens);
                }
    - This demo does not fully work so it's in code but not linked from the main site.
      Seems like it may be an issue due to Rax and not the jsxLoader. See comments in the HTML file.
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/countries-no-spa-rax.htm

*) Many Docs need to be created along with API page(s)
    - API needs a quick search/filter feature to look up any attribute/class/function/etc
        and find where it is defined and how to use it.
    - UI/UX still needs to be decided on for API docs
    - Or Docs can simply be added to GitHub as Markdown Docs

*) Create Server-side Starter Sites in all widely used Languages and Frameworks
    - Include ability for content to be defined server-side and saved to a SQLite Db

*) Docs and demos to Create
    - Cleanup [DataFormsJS\examples\handlebars-helpers.htm] and add to to the main
        examples page. Also create a similar [vue-directives.htm] file.
        - For cleanup likely add a new plugin [refreshOnTimer] to refresh the page
          on a defined interval from the HTML controller.
        - Need to demonstrate all Handlebars Helpers such as {{#ifJS}}
    - Framework Event Order (note - Vue varies slightly)
        ====================================================
        Page Event Order when a URL Changes:
        ------
        plugins.onRouteUnload()
        controller.onRouteUnload(model as this)
        plugins.onRouteLoad(next)
        controller.onRouteLoad(model as this)
        ... Then code below:
        --------------------------------------------------
        Event Order for when app.updateView() is called.
        This can happen multiple times per URL/Hash Change:
        ------
        controller.onBeforeRender(model as this)
        plugins.onBeforeRender()
        -- HTML Template Rendered --
        -- HTML Controls Rendered --   Elements with [data-template-id] or [data-template-url]
        -- JS Controled Loaded -- Custom JS Controls defined by [js/controls]
        plugins.onRendered()
        controller.onRendered(model as this)
        app.onUpdateViewComplete()  # Global event - typically for Unit Testing only
        ====================================================
    - Getting Started Page
        - See comments in: [Website\public\js\page-getting-started.js] under [viewTemplate.onclick]
            Templates should possibly be rendered from PHP server-side. FastSitePHP has
            and I18N API that is similar to DataFormsJS so it would be easy to convert.
        - Likely add a regions page that is downloaded from CDN, this would also need to handle
            translations so server-side code would help here
    - If using Vue then document and show examples of which controller functions are called
        by which Vue events - search [DataForms.js] for "new Vue".
        - Example [Controlller.onRouteLoad] is called by [Vue.mounted]
    - Vue - [app.activeVueModel] can be used but not on the first [onRendered], apps should use [this]
    - How to use custom events for <url-router> and <json-data>
      See comments in JS code at bottom of:
        DataFormsJS\examples\places-demo-web.htm
    - How to use Authorization and various options, see example in [DataFormsJS\examples\entry-form-demo-hbs.htm]
    - Document with an example of why most event listener functions should be defined
      in separate named functions outside of [addEventListener]. For example if
      an anonymous function is added and the plugin is called multiple times on
      the same element then multiple functions would be called. Example [clickToHighlight]
      uses [toggleHighlight()], if not used and [app.plugins.clickToHighlight.onRendered()]
      were called several times then it performs the same action several times.
    - How to use [app.loadScript()], example:
            var url = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@2.9.2/dist/Chart.min.js';
            app.loadScript(window.Chart, url, callback);
        or:
            app.loadScript(window.Chart, url).then(function() {
                // Code for Chart
            });
        To load script 1st Parameter needs to be [false] or [undefined]:
            (window.Promise && window.fetch ? true : false)
            window.fetch
    - How [app.lazyLoad], [data-lazy-load] and [app.loadScripts] works, for starting point
      see comments in:
        DataFormsJS\examples\places-demo-hbs.htm
    - How to setup a local development - create the following folders, download needed files to them,
      then comment out CDN links and uncomment the vendor links.
        DataFormsJS\vendor
        DataFormsJS\test\vendor\qunit
    - Examples in the [js/templates/*] such as [page-object.js] will likely be moved to documentation
        pages and the template files more minimal with only [console.log()] on the events.
        In the future there should be unit tests for the [js/templates/*] files.
    - Custom Controls, for example usage see [DataFormsJS\examples\js-control-demos-hbs.htm]
        That file can be a starting point to see code for how to build custom controls.
        In the future there should also be one or more [DataFormsJS\js\templates\*.js] files
        for custom controls.
    - Need demos for Handlebar Helpers, Vue Directives and React Format class
    - All Parameters for I18N Files and Classes, example for React:
        const defaultLocale = 'en';
        const supportedLocales = ['en', 'ja'];
        const fileName = 'countries';
        const fileDir = 'http://localhost:3000/i18n';
        const i18n = new I18n(defaultLocale, supportedLocales, fileName, fileDir);

    - How to delay a loading screen for a specific time through CSS, see example in:
        Website\public\html\getting-started\getting-started.css
    - MNIST Keras/TensorFlow demo with JS Plugin to allow user to draw number
    - How to replicate embedded page links using hash URL:
        Normally <a href="#target"> would work to link to:
            <div id="target">
        However because SPA hash routing is used App would redirect to another page
        Example work-around:
            <a href="javascript:document.getElementById('target').scrollIntoView();window.scrollTo(0, window.pageYOffset-100);">
        In the future this could be make into a generic plugin. The [window.scrollTo()] is used above to handle
        a fixed header in a specific app.
    - Show difference between jQuery, Object.assign() and app.deepClone() in a doc
        jQuery adds to an array rather than replace it
			var data = { a:[ {o1:1}, {o2:2}, {o3:3}, {o4:4} ] }
			$.extend(true, data, { a:[ {o1:'a'}, {o2:'b'}, {o3:'c'} ] })
		Then:
			data = { a:[ {o1:'a'}, {o2:'b'}, {o3:'c'}, {o4:4}  ] }
			- Issue with jQuery Deep Clone [o4] is still kept which results in
              in unexpected results for the Json Data Services (page.jsonData, <JsonData>, etc)
		Compare with:
			Object.assign(true, data, { a:[ {o1:'a'}, {o2:'b'}, {o3:'c'} ] })
			app.deepClone(data, { a:[ {o1:'a'}, {o2:'b'}, {o3:'c'} ] })
		Show this as a more practical example (real records in an array)

		# Object.assign() works but will set a ref to original nested array
        var data = { a:[1,2,3] }
        var data2 = Object.assign({}, data)
			# compare with: [var data2 = app.deepClone({}, data)]
        data2.a === data.a
        data.a.push(4)
        data2.a.indexOf(4)

    - Add CodeMirror support for GraphQL
        At the time of writing GraphQL is not a built-in mode for CodeMirror:
            https://codemirror.net/mode/index.html
        Instead Facebook uses their own custom mode and it requires a custom build process and not CDN, see:
            https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/master/packages/codemirror-graphql

*) DataFormsJS\js\React\jsPlugins.js
    How to handle [Plugin.onRouteUnload()]? Not yet needed with common framework plugins but needed
    for future plugins that use [window.setInterval] or [window.setTimeout]

*) DataFormsJS\js\Plugins\highlighter.js
    - Allow users to define text results such as "{count} Records matched [{value}]"
    - Need ability to handle multiple languages

*) dataformsjs\js\plugins\codemirror.js
    - Create a demo page (both Vue and Handlebars)
    - This would likely include a web service that returns different example code in multiple languages from the server
    - Possibly add an options to save changes automatically from the textarea. Example:
        app.plugins.codemirror.saveEditsAutomatically = true;
    - The option could be setup to be `true` by default. That would change the behavior of the plugin,
        however in general this plugin would likely be used as a template plugin anyways.

*) todomvc Example
    - Possibly publish it as a separate Repository with notes on how to copy?
    - Or keep core files with notes on how to install?
    - Future - run unit tests against it:
        https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/tests

*) Add unit tests for momentjs with handlebars - or add to a separate page?
    - Originally it was included but has been removed from the initial release:
            <div id="moment-01">{{moment (now) "YYYY.MM.DD"}}</div>
            <div id="moment-02">{{moment dateTime "YYYY.MM.DD, h:mm:ss A"}}</div>
            { id: "moment-01", value: (new Date()).getFullYear(), type: "contains" },
            { id: "moment-02", value: "2015.01.31, 1:23:45 PM" },

*) Chosen Plugin, need examples or docs showing how callbacks from [app.events.on] are used

*) Log Demo [log-table-hbs.htm], [log-table-vue.htm], etc
    - move <h1>, and <nav> outside of the render section so that they do not flash
        when cleared from each screen. Would need to make sure the [clear filter]
        button doesn't get set multiple times.
        Also possibly do this for the <input filter> control.

*) GraphQL
    - Add GraphQL support on [pages/entryForm.js]
    - Add support for other GraphQL types such as Float.
        Currently only Strings and Integers are supported, see:
        https://graphql.org/graphql-js/basic-types/
        - Related Code:
            app.buildGraphQLVariables()
    - Can the file [app\app.js] be easily updated to avoid using "SELECT *"
        on SQL queries and get only the requested fields. Only do this if it
        doesn't take too much code because the file is meant to be a simple
        and readable demo. See the following link:
        https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-demystifying-the-info-argument-in-graphql-resolvers-6f26249f613a
    - Add GET support for GraphQL in:
        DataFormsJS\js\controls\json-data.js
      See how it can be done from:
        DataFormsJS\js\pages\jsonData.js
      When adding a demo page needs to be created to test

*) Create Unit Tests for the following functions:
    Controller.onRouteUnload

*) Improve Unit tests for IE 11
    - Typically they work about 50% of the time, however several routes have an
      issue related to calls for [tester.pageTester2]
    - It appears that [app.onUpdateViewComplete] is being called twice the first time
      that it should be called. The reason for this is not yet known.
    - It's not yet determine if this is a bug or related to IE behavior. Regardless
      DataFormsJS has been used extensively with IE Users for many years before it was
      released so it's known to work well with IE.
    - To test the issue find and update the following code in [dataformsjs\test\js\unit-testing-core.js]:
                // After checking the 'Page is Loading' message define a new
                // [onUpdateViewComplete] function to check the final response.
                app.onUpdateViewComplete = function () {
                    // Now check the 2nd state (usually after a web service response)
                    assert.equal(window.location.hash, hash, 'Hash Check - ' + hash);
                    if (expectHtml2 !== null) {
                        //// **** This block is the section to add for manual testing.
                        if (hash === '#/page-json-data-load-only-once' || hash === '#/page-reload-json-data' || hash === '#/missing-page-json-data') {
                            var html = document.getElementById('view').textContent.trim();
                            if (html !== expectHtml2) {
                                console.log(hash);
                                console.log(expectHtml2);
                                console.log(html);
                            }
                        }
                        tester.checkElement('view', expectHtml2, assert);
                    }

*) Additional Unit Testing for the following functions, props, etc:
    data-engine:
        Validate error message in [app.setup()] at [(viewEngine === ViewEngines.Unknown)]
        This will be similar to the unit test for "template-invalid-path"
    app.deepClone() - Test with getter/setter props
    app.loadScript()
    [app.lazyLoad] and all related features including [app.loadScripts]
        See additional comments in next item below
    app.loadJsControl(), examples
        - verify [app.activeJsControls[n].data] objects
        - manually call and recall [app.loadJsControl()]
    app.unloadAllJsControls()
        - manually test before a route is unloaded or when page is called with updateView
    [data-default-route] used to specify default route from script element (used on the main web site)
    app.locals
    controller.settings
        - using Arrays, Objects, etc
    Event Order for manual calls to [refreshHtmlControl()] and [refreshAllHtmlControls()]
        and how they call [refreshPlugins()] and [loadAllJsControls()].
        This can probably be checked in test "Route Change and Event Order"
        - Params should be tested for these functions as well
    addPlugin(name, function)
        Currently only [addPlugin(name, object)] is validated
    addPage() and addController()
        When creating Unit Tests for Vue these two functions should exclude the function [onBeforeRender]
        from validation in case a controller only defines that function. When using Vue [onBeforeRender()]
        is not called - low priority updated needed in [DataForms.js] for this
    app.settings.getRequestHeaders
        - Example:
            app.settings.requestHeaders = { "X-Test-Header": "Test123", "X-Test2": "ABC" };
            app.settings.requestHeadersByHostName = { localhost: { "X-Test-Header": "123456789" }};
            app.getRequestHeaders("http://localhost/test");
            app.getRequestHeaders("https://www.example.com/");
    Test parameters for all [apply(app.activeModel, app.activeParameters)] code
    app.handleGlobalErrors()
    <templates> = [display:none] for IE but not other browsers
    plugin.onRouteLoad
    Create a separate page for testing features if no controllers are included on a page
        verify that plugins run, etc
    data-set-text-content
    app.getTemplateType()
        Error under [(script.tagName !== 'TEMPLATE' && script.tagName !== 'SCRIPT')] is not tested
    CSS Error Styles that were added after Unit Tests were initially created:
        '.dataformsjs-error,.dataformsjs-fatal-error{',
            'white-space:pre;',
            'text-align:left;',

*) Update for previous Unit Tests that changed when [app.lazyLoad] as added.
    - Before [app.lazyLoad] the pages had to be defined when controllers were added
      so this code was included under [DataFormsJS.js -> addController()]
        if (controller.pageType !== null && controller.pageType !== undefined) {
            ...
            validateObjectExists(this.pages[controller.pageType], 'app.pages.' + controller.pageType, funcName);
            validateTypeOf(this.pages[controller.pageType].model, 'object', 'app.pages.' + controller.pageType + '.model', funcName);
    - And the following were tested in [unit-testing.js]:
            try {
                expectedMessage = "[app.pages.MissingPage] must first be defined before the function app.addController(path=Test) is called";
                app.addController({ path: "Test", pageType: "MissingPage" });
                assert.ok(false, "Test should have failed");
            } catch (e) {
                assert.ok(e instanceof TypeError, "Exception should be a TypeError");
                assert.equal(e.message, expectedMessage, expectedMessage);
            }

            try {
                //First add an invalid page manually without using app.addPage()
                //This error would happen if the developer overwrites a page object
                //as a invalid type or if they manually add an invalid page.
                app.pages.InvalidPage = { model: function () { return ""; } };
                tester.pagesCount++;

                //Run the test
                expectedMessage = "[app.pages.InvalidPage.model] was not defined as a object when the function app.addController(path=Test) was called";
                app.addController({ path: "Test", pageType: "InvalidPage" });
                assert.ok(false, "Test should have failed");
            } catch (e) {
                assert.ok(e instanceof TypeError, "Exception should be a TypeError");
                assert.equal(e.message, expectedMessage, expectedMessage);
            }
    - That validation is now handled in [function setControllerFromPage(controller)] with the following code
			if (app.pages[controller.pageType] === undefined) {
				error = 'The page [' + controller.pageType + '] has not been loaded for Controller[path=' + controller.path + '].';
			} else if (typeof app.pages[controller.pageType].model !== 'object') {
				error = 'Error - The [model] property for page object [' + controller.pageType + '] must be a valid JavaScript Object.';
			}
    - The new validation needs to be tested and will have to use hash routing to check the view after hash change for the errors

*) DataFormsJS Object
    *) app.addPage("name", callback)
        if function is passed then it will create page as
            { model:{}, onRendered:callback }
        similar to how [app.addPlugin()] works with a callback function
    *) More HTML defaults for things such as [app.settings.defaultRoute]?
        document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-show-errors')
    *) app.routeMatches() should not match "/" to [data-route="/:count"]
    *) Need a redirect function, currently using this in one of the demos:
        app.addController({ path:"/", onBeforeRender:function() {
            window.location.hash = "#/20";
        }});
        * Something will need to be fixed now since ":lang" will be used
        on the main site
    *) Add [app.settings.fetchOptionsByHostName] which will be similar
        to [requestHeadersByHostName] and add a related [getFetchOptons()]
        function that will be similar to [getRequestHeaders()].

*) Page [entryForm]
    *) Add support for radio input controls
    *) Add support for additional [data-type] values
    *) Keep [Save] button disabled if there are no changes
        Try adding this first as a separate plugin
    *) <input type="file"> likely to be handled with various plugin options and example server code
        see the image classification demo for now
    *) Add validation options to highlight invalid controls
    *) Possibly here or in [plugins/listEditor.js] add a [saveFormat] option with values such as
        "all-records" or "changes-only". Various Server Side code examples need to go with it

*) Plugin [clickUrlAction]
    *) Add options for showing loading or indicator, etc or a or callback for user to handle
    *) If a new page is loaded before this service downloads then don't write back to active model
        To start a simple currentUrl <> previousUrl can be used
    *) Action "refresh-html-controls" should also support an optional [data-controls-selector]

*) Extension validation
    *) Many more validations needed including all HTML standard attributes such as <input pattern>

*) Unit Test all Possible Errors
    For example a specific plugin that throws an exception from [onRendered()]

*) New Unit Test Page to Test Controls, Plugins, etc when not using Single-Page-App (Controllers)

*) Support Built-In Timers for both Controller and Controls?
    data-refresh-time-interval="1000"
    Currently [refreshTimeInterval] is available on the [json-data] Control
*) Handlebars Helpers
    - Make sure all helpers are tested - examples of needed [nlbr, yesNo, yesNoNull]
    - More testing of different languages, etc
    - Test all options for ifCond
    - 'join' function to work on array properties
